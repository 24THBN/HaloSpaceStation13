# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - maptweak: "rebalances the Geminus MAC to require time and effort to activate and use."
  - maptweak: "Geminus MAC starts with no generators or power supply, must be obtained by grabbing generators around the map and fuelling them with solid phoron / tritium."
  - maptweak: "Geminus MAC also now has a much longer charge time of 30 seconds when fully powered. This, coupled with the lowered amount of capacitors (it now does ~2000 damage instead of 2600) means that the MAC doesn't draw 490000w of power per tick. Instead it now draws 12500w per tick."
  - tweak: "Lowers kig-yar brute mod by 1 (1.2 -> 1.1 / 1.3 -> 1.2)"

changes: 
  - tweak: "Temporarily switched around the posisition of inniecomms and cmdocomms on the commando headset. This should allow inniecomms to be used by commandos on the :h key until the issue with inniecomms is fixed"
  - tweak: "Made the anti-material rounds exactly the same as the SRS rounds, to reduce Commando crying about it. The weapon also has a scope placement that makes more sense - Weapon tab rather than object."
  - rscadd: "Added Backpacks for commandos to their vendor. Credits to Eluxor for the sprites."

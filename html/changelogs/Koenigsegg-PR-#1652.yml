changes: 
  - rscadd: "Biogenerators can now print advanced trauma/burn kits for 100 units of bio matter. Plants have joined the war effort."
  - rscadd: "Add the SOE Osprey ship, for the SOE commandos. It's big. It's bad. But most importantly... it flies."
  - rscadd: "Add an SOE Commando Captain role, which is the only one that can enter the captains quarters on the ship. Likely to hide their crippling depression."
  - rscadd: "Add spawnpoints for the commandos, on the SOE Osprey instead of the listening outpost. Just in case."
  - rscdel: "Delete the old URFC Avarice and the unused 2nd deck map file. Clearly, another victim of Thanos."
  - tweak: "Change the URFC Commandos for SOE Commandos in various files. URFC is officialy gone."
